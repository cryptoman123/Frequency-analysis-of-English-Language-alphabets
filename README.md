<h1>FREQUENCY ANALYSIS</h1>
<h2>of alphabets in English language</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
When you write an essay or a message in English language and encrypt it with a Shift cipher. the frequency at which the alphabets occur remains the same. This frequency can be used to decode the encrypted messages. Here we will see a simple example of how to find those frequencies and use them to decode any shift cipher encrypted message.
<h3>Background</h3>
<p><b>Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100BC â€“ 15 March 44BC)</b> used what we today call <b>monoalphabetic cipher</b>, to have his messages delivered in a way that no one else could read them other than the receiver. This was the first encryption and was decrpted by an Arabic mathematician <b>Abu al-Kindi</b> in the 9th century.<br>
This encrption technique has following names:<br>
1. <b>Caesar's Cypher</b> <br>
2. <b>Shift Cypher</b> <br>
